Started out with 15x15, and tried training LeNet on database, but quickly ran into several roadblocks. Model accuracy was bad\. 
There was no specific reason stated as to why 15x15 was chosen, nor why only LeNet was tried. Model hyperparameter initializations\. 
were also not given, so it was difficult to replicate results, especially since only MaxE, RMSE are given, but not accuracies.
